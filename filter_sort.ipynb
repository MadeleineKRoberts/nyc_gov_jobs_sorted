Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â from New York Cityâs yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâs impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are: 1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems  2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods 3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness 4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health 5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change  Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health.

health for all New Yorkers by providing 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water, managing wastewater and stormwater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution.  DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  New York City has approximately 140,000 catch basins, 114,000 hydrants, 90,000 valves, 14 gatehouses, 3 reservoirs, 68 groundwater wells, a 100 million gallon underground storage tank and 7,000 miles each of both sanitary sewers and water mains. The responsibility of maintaining these vast networks falls under the Department of Environmental Protectionâs Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO).  The primary responsibilities of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations are: the operation, maintenance and protection of the Cityâs drinking water and wastewater collection (sewer) systems; the protection of adjacent waterways; and the development and protection of the Departmentâs Capital Water and Sewer Design Program. The Bureau also approves and inspects water and sewer connections performed by licensed plumbers and/or authorized contractors. In addition, the Bureau has overall responsibility for the approval and inspection of all public and private construction projects which could impact on the Cityâs water or sewer systems.  The Bureau is also responsible for the operation of the Staten Island Bluebelt. This is an ecologically sound, cost effective natural alternative to storm sewers, which occupies approximately 15 square miles of land in the South Richmond area of Staten Island. This project preserves streams, ponds and other wetland (bluebelt) areas, allowing them to perform their natural function of conveying, storing and filtering storm water. These areas also provide important community open spaces and a diverse wildlife habitat.  The Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO) is looking to hire a data scientist to build efficient, machine learning, data-driven predictive models using spatial data to forecast trends and outcomes within an ESRI geospatial platform. The candidate should be highly skilled in statistics and programming, with the ability to confidently assess, analyze, and organize large amounts of data. The candidate should be able to program, test and execute custom Python scripts. Additional responsibilities include:  ~ development of interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring and reporting of spatial data and analyses as required by Bureau Management;   ~ documentation of programming instructions, methodologies, data sources and procedural manuals;  ~ preparation and participation with product presentations.  *****IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AN INTERVIEW, YOU MUST BE PERMANENT IN THE TITLE OF CERTIFIED IT DEVELOPER (APPLICATIONS).   \n",
