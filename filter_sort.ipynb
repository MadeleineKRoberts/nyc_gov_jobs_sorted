Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.  As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â from New York Cityâs yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.  Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are: 1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems  2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods 3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness 4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health 5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change  Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâs impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes. ___  The Bureau of Vital Statistics is responsible for registering and maintaining records of all births and deaths that occur in New York City.

Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees. DEP delivers more than 1.1 billion gallons per day of the highest quality drinking water to 8.5 million NYC residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and has a wastewater conveyance and treatment system capable of processing over 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day to protect the environment and the cityâs surrounding waterways.    The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT) is responsible for the operation and maintenance of all facilities related to the treatment of sewage within the five boroughs of the city. This includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, sludge dewatering facilities, collections facilities (pumping stations, combined sewer overflow retention facilities, regulators, tide gates, etc.), wastewater laboratories and harbor vessels. The Marine Science Section is tasked with performing the NY Harbor Survey Program. The Survey is an ambient water quality monitoring effort performed year-round within New York Harbor. Stations are sampled by boat or by vehicle. The MSS is responsible for generating an annual report and administrating several water quality related contracts.   The selected candidate assigned to the City Research Scientist III position will act as data manager of the section and will be responsible for the maintenance and reporting of all data produced by the section. This candidate will act as QA/QC manager and will be responsible for the daily/weekly QAQC of all data, ensuring that all values are entered correctly and are consistent across all forms of data recording (field sheets, main HS spreadsheet, and tablet database). Frequent QAQC of data is needed to ensure all data being sent externally has been verified and thoroughly checked. The selected candidate will also be responsible for data reporting, from annual reports showing long term trends to the frequent uploading of data points into a public facing database. These reports require statistical analysis of data on a regional and harbor wide scale as well as the creation of trend graphs and analytical write ups. Additionally, it is the selected candidateâs duty to ensure all Harbor Survey personnel are following sampling protocols and standard operating procedures, as well as ensure all equipment is properly calibrated and functional to produce high quality results.   \n",

enriches the environment and protects public health for all New Yorkers by providing 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water, managing wastewater and stormwater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution.  DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  New York City has approximately 140,000 catch basins, 114,000 hydrants, 90,000 valves, 14 gatehouses, 3 reservoirs, 68 groundwater wells, a 100 million gallon underground storage tank and 7,000 miles each of both sanitary sewers and water mains. The responsibility of maintaining these vast networks falls under the Department of Environmental Protectionâs Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO).  The primary responsibilities of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations are: the operation, maintenance and protection of the Cityâs drinking water and wastewater collection (sewer) systems; the protection of adjacent waterways; and the development and protection of the Departmentâs Capital Water and Sewer Design Program. The Bureau also approves and inspects water and sewer connections performed by licensed plumbers and/or authorized contractors. In addition, the Bureau has overall responsibility for the approval and inspection of all public and private construction projects which could impact on the Cityâs water or sewer systems.  The Bureau is also responsible for the operation of the Staten Island Bluebelt. This is an ecologically sound, cost effective natural alternative to storm sewers, which occupies approximately 15 square miles of land in the South Richmond area of Staten Island. This project preserves streams, ponds and other wetland (bluebelt) areas, allowing them to perform their natural function of conveying, storing and filtering storm water. These areas also provide important community open spaces and a diverse wildlife habitat.  The Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO) is looking to hire a data scientist to build efficient, machine learning, data-driven predictive models using spatial data to forecast trends and outcomes within an ESRI geospatial platform. The candidate should be highly skilled in statistics and programming, with the ability to confidently assess, analyze, and organize large amounts of data. The candidate should be able to program, test and execute custom Python scripts. Additional responsibilities include:  ~ development of interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring and reporting of spatial data and analyses as required by Bureau Management;   ~ documentation of programming instructions, methodologies, data sources and procedural manuals;  ~ preparation and participation with product presentations.  *****IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AN INTERVIEW, YOU MUST BE PERMANENT IN THE TITLE OF CERTIFIED IT DEVELOPER (APPLICATIONS).   \n",

responsible for planning and oversight of the Citi Bike program and other shared micro mobility services in New York City. Citi Bike is a public transportation service and a public-private partnership that is among the largest and most successful bike share systems in the world. The program is in the midst of a five-year expansion that will ultimately double the size of its previous service area and put more than 40,000 bicycles within a five-minute walk of half of NYC residents. Other shared micro mobility services in NYC include dock less e-scooter share, which will soon expand from the East Bronx into Eastern Queens, and e-moped share.  Under the direction of the Executive Director, this candidate will lead a team of data scientists/analysts and will perform research and analysis activities related to bike share and shared mobility that will inform current and future planning; conduct economic research and studies involving estimates and forecasts regarding transportation-share services; collect, classify, evaluate, and analyze data, develop predictive models to answer complex and nuanced questions about the programs and anticipate future needs and behavior of the systems; prepare reports and briefing materials based on databases that underlie the bike share and shared mobility systems; monitor vendor compliance with governmental regulations, DOT policies, and contract terms; establish and monitor best practices, policies, procedures and documentation around bike share and shared mobility data; plan, design, maintain, and support unit internal databases; communicate technical issues to technical and non-technical audiences; and perform related duties. This candidate will serve as the Bike Share & Shared Mobility unitâs primary technical liaison to micro mobility vendors and data management providers.   \n",

Commission (TLC) is the City agency responsible for regulating for-hire transportation in New York City, including taxis, street hail liveries, high-volume for-hire services such as Uber and Lyft, black cars, luxury limousines, livery vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The TLC licenses about 180,000 drivers, 118,000 vehicles, and 1,000 businesses, which together transport more than a million passengers a day, making TLC the most active for-hire transportation regulatory agency in the world with oversight of a key component of the Cityâs transportation network. With the introduction of new apps and technologies, TLC is on the front lines of a rapidly changing mobility landscape and our innovative efforts--whether regulating driver pay, ensuring wheelchair accessibility, working to eliminate traffic fatalities, or preventing discriminatory service--often serve as a model for other cities.  We are looking for a motivated Data Engineer to join our Data Analytics Unit within the Policy Division. You'll be working with large datasets, including detailed trip data for every taxi and for-hire vehicle in New York City. The Data Engineer will work closely with other team members to understand the teamâs ongoing data ingestion and processes. This role is crucial in processing and analyzing billions of trip records, requiring expertise in big data technologies and distributed computing. The data includes detailed information on passenger wait times, pickup and drop-off locations, minute-level breadcrumb pings, passenger costs, and driver pay.   Weâre seeking a Data Engineer who is excited to work with big data to help shape transportation policy in NYC. You will manage our data pipelines, enhance data governance, and bridge the gap between modern cloud-based solutions and legacy systems. Your work will involve building and maintaining the data and the technologies which are tied to our teamâs ongoing projects such as traffic congestion, fare regulation, driver pay, vehicle electrification, and charging infrastructure.   As a Data Engineer on our team, you will be performing the following tasks: â¢  Design, implement, and maintain scalable data pipelines. â¢  Own internal data validations and documentation processes along with the data engineering team.  â¢  Collaborate with data analysts and policy researchers on a variety of projects, including translating business and policy requirements into data schemas and models. â¢  Develop and maintain tools for automating and modernizing our data processes.   â¢  Liaise with other departments to bridge gaps in existing processes and tools.  â¢  Track, test, develop and deploy code.   â¢  Analyze existing analytics code, modularizing and refactoring code where needed. â¢  Troubleshoot and complex data issues and implement robust solutions.   \n",

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York Cityâs yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services.

Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are: 1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods 3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness 4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health 5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change  Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâs impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis.

            This candidate will serve as Data Analyst in NYC DOTâs Bike Share & Shared Mobility unit, which is responsible for planning and oversight of the Citi Bike program and other shared micro mobility services in New York City. Citi Bike is a public transportation service and a public-private partnership that is among the largest and most successful bike share systems in the world. The program is in the midst of a five-year expansion that will ultimately double the size of its previous service area and put more than 40,000 bicycles within a five-minute walk of half of NYC residents. Other shared micro mobility services in NYC include dock less e-scooter share and e-moped share.  Under the direction of the Executive Director and senior unit staff, this candidate will perform research and analysis activities related to bike share and shared mobility that will inform current and future planning; conduct economic research and studies involving estimates and forecasts regarding transportation-share services; collect, classify, evaluate, and analyze data, develop predictive models to answer complex and nuanced questions about the programs and anticipate future needs and behavior of the systems; prepare reports and briefing materials based on databases that underlie the bike share and shared mobility systems; monitor vendor compliance with governmental regulations, DOT policies, and contract terms; establish and monitor best practices, policies, procedures and documentation around bike share and shared mobility data; plan, design, maintain, and support unit internal databases; communicate technical issues to technical and non-technical audiences; and perform related duties. Experience working with large datasets using SQL and proficiency in Python, which may include pandas and/or geo-pandas, is required.   \n",

Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â from New York Cityâs yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâs impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis.

health for all New Yorkers by providing 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water, managing wastewater and stormwater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution.  DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  New York City has approximately 140,000 catch basins, 114,000 hydrants, 90,000 valves, 14 gatehouses, 3 reservoirs, 68 groundwater wells, a 100 million gallon underground storage tank and 7,000 miles each of both sanitary sewers and water mains. The responsibility of maintaining these vast networks falls under the Department of Environmental Protectionâs Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO).  The primary responsibilities of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations are: the operation, maintenance and protection of the Cityâs drinking water and wastewater collection (sewer) systems; the protection of adjacent waterways; and the development and protection of the Departmentâs Capital Water and Sewer Design Program. The Bureau also approves and inspects water and sewer connections performed by licensed plumbers and/or authorized contractors. In addition, the Bureau has overall responsibility for the approval and inspection of all public and private construction projects which could impact on the Cityâs water or sewer systems.  The Bureau is also responsible for the operation of the Staten Island Bluebelt. This is an ecologically sound, cost effective natural alternative to storm sewers, which occupies approximately 15 square miles of land in the South Richmond area of Staten Island. This project preserves streams, ponds and other wetland (bluebelt) areas, allowing them to perform their natural function of conveying, storing and filtering storm water. These areas also provide important community open spaces and a diverse wildlife habitat.  Within the Capital Program Management (CPM) Team, the Chief of Strategic Planning is seeking a Data Analyst to manage budgeting work, analyze data for strategic planning, and for project delivery processes, assess data management needs. The Data Analyst will prepare and track capital budget plans and project delivery status through extensive coordination with internal and external stakeholders. Responsibilities include identifying and tracking variances between planned and actual expenditures, and comparing current and future project budgets against previous budget plans. This role calls for the analysis, identification, and reporting of data gaps and needs for the development of a capital investment management strategy. The Data Analyst will work closely with BWSOâs Operations Analysis & Regulatory Compliance group to ultimately develop and manage a coordinated data flow to increase the efficiency of capital planning workflow processes.  ***IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AN INTERVIEW, ALL CANDIDATES MUST HAVE FILED FOR THE MOST RECENT CIVIL SERVICE EXAM FOR ADMINISTRATICE STAFF ANALYST, OR BE PERMANENT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE TITLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ANALYST.   \n",
